# Lucas William Bateson

Personal organization for self-hosted infrastructure, side projects, and experiments.

## Why This Org?

This organization serves as a centralized home for all my personal projects and self-hosted services. Having a dedicated org allows me to:

- **Manage GitHub App integrations** - My CI/CD platform (Foundry) uses a GitHub App that works at the org level
- **Organize related repositories** - All infrastructure, websites, and tools in one place
